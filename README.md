# Ptero-VM in a JAR.
This project is a Java implementation of [Afnan's Ptero-VM](https://github.com/afnan007a/Ptero-vm) that was made for Pterodactyl, this project was created to support a even larger variety of hosting services than Ptero-VM could.

### How does this work
The jarfile downloads another file that can be seen [here](https://github.com/afnan007a/Ptero-vm/blob/main/installer.sh), afterwards it executes it, the script goes ahead and installs a PRoot enviroment in your server (also known as a docker container), this allows you to execute *most* root Linux commands on your server.

### Compiling
1. Download all of the files in this repository.
2. Open a Terminal.
3. Run `javac Main.java`, it is suggested to use Java 8 for this process for compatibility purposes.
4. Afterwards, run `ls` or `dir` to make sure you have `Main.class` in the same folder as `manifest.txt`.
5. Now, run `cvfm server.jar manifest.txt Main.class` to compile into a jarfile and you're done!

### Issues
If you experience an issue whilst running or compiling Ptero-VM in a JAR, please open a new issue, if your issue is related to compilation, please make sure you are compiling correctly according to the guidelines above and that you have not tampered with the `.java` file.
